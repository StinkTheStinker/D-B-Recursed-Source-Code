## Installation:
You must have [the most up-to-date version of Haxe](https://haxe.org/download/), seriously, stop using 4.1.5, it misses some stuff.

The source code should come with a "Quick SETUP" batch file that came with the JS Engine Source Code. Run it in order to install all the needed libraries for *Mod*

## Customization:

If you want to, you can customize it, always to the `project.xml` file.
